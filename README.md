- My background as a .NET developer has equipped me with extensive experience in building and maintaining web applications using C#, ASP.NET Core, and related technologies. This technical proficiency is complemented by a solid foundation in software development principles gained through my academic studies in IT and my professional experiences.

At Huboweb, I have developed backend code for websites and APIs, tested and processed data, and implemented secure authentication methods. My work on the Patient Utility and AuditApp projects highlights my ability to handle complex technical tasks and collaborate effectively with teams to meet project requirements. My internship at SoftConsult further refined my skills in developing web and win forms, writing SQL stored procedures, and documenting backend processes to guide frontend teams.

In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about addressing social issues through technology. My final year project, E-Dasterkhwan App, aimed to reduce food waste and support low-income communities by facilitating food donations and composting. This experience underscores my commitment to using technology for social good and my ability to manage projects from conception to implementation.

My proficiency in both English and Urdu allows me to communicate effectively with diverse groups. I am dedicated to continuous improvement and enjoy engaging in technology-related meetups and collaborative projects.
